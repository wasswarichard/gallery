Create a repository on GitHub, initialised with an empty Readme.

Work on a branch.

Build a simple ReactJS, or VueJS-based frontend app to display photos from an API. Youâ€™re welcome to use basic HTML & CSS to display, or an out the box UI toolkit. The app should only display one album on screen at any time, with navigation buttons to go to the next gallery, or the previous gallery.

Fetch data from the relevant API(s) on https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

For submission, open a pull request against the main branch with all your changes, and send a link to the PR.

Key success criteria:

Instructions on how to build and run the application locally in the README file.
A working application per the spec above, focus on a functional, working album browser. A working but ugly browser is more important than a beautiful broken app, but a pleasuing UI/UX will be appreciated.
A pull-request of changes against the main branch.
Nice-to-haves:

A slick UI that shows off your love of the craft
Runnable as a Docker based build/run
